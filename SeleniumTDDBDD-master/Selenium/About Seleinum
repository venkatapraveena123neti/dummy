We can use Selenium only to test web applications. We cannot test desktop applications or any other software
There is no guaranteed support available for Selenium. We need to leverage on the available customer communities
It is not possible to perform testing on images. We need to integrate Selenium with Sikuli for image based testing
There is no native reporting facility. But we can overcome that issue by integrating it with frameworks like TestNG or JUnit.
----------------------
Manual testing means the (web) application is tested manually by QA testers. Tests need to be performed manually in every 
environment, using a different data set and the success/ failure rate of every transaction should be recorded.
