Software test metrics is to monitor and control process and product. It helps to drive the project towards our planned goals without deviation.

Metrics answer different questions. It’s important to decide what questions you want answers to.

Software test metrics are classified into two types
>>Process metrics
>>Product metrics

Test Case Preparation Productivity:
It is used to calculate the number of Test Cases prepared and the effort spent for the preparation of Test Cases.

Formula:Test Case Preparation Productivity = (No of Test Case)/ (Effort spent for Test Case Preparation)

Ex:No. of Test cases = 240

Effort spent for Test case preparation (in hours) = 10

Test Case preparation productivity = 240/80 = 30 test cases/hour

--------------------------------------

Test Design Coverage:
It helps to measure the percentage of test case coverage against the number of requirements

Formula:
Test Design Coverage = ((Total number of requirements mapped to test cases) / (Total number of requirements)*100

Ex:

Total number of requirements: 100

Total number of requirements mapped to test cases: 98

Test Design Coverage = (98/100)*100 = 98%

--------------------------------------------------
Test Execution Productivity:
It determines the number of Test Cases that can be executed per hour.
(No of Test cases executed)/ (Effort spent for execution of test cases)

Ex:No of Test cases executed = 180

Effort spent for execution of test cases = 10

Test Execution Productivity = 180/10 = 18 test cases/hour
---------------------------------------------------------------

Test Execution Coverage:
It is to measure the number of test cases executed against the number of test cases planed.

Formula:
Test Execution Coverage = (Total no. of test cases executed / Total no. of test cases planned to execute)*100

Ex:Total no. of test cases planned to execute = 240

Total no. of test cases executed = 160

Test Execution Coverage = (180/240)*100 = 75%
----------------------------------------------
Test Cases Passed:
It is to measure the percentage no. of test cases passed

Formula:
Test Cases Failed = (Total no. of test cases failed) / (Total no. of test cases executed) * 100

Ex:Test Cases Pass = (80/90)*100 = 88.8 = 89%

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Test Cases Failed:
It is to measure the percentage no. of test cases failed

Formula:
Test Cases Failed = (Total no. of test cases failed) / (Total no. of test cases executed) * 100

Ex:Test Cases Failed= (10/90)*100 = 11.1 = 11%

-----------------------------------------------------------
Defect Fix Rate:
It helps to know the quality of a build in terms of defect fixing.

Formula:
Defect Fix Rate = (Total no of Defects reported as fixed - Total no. of defects reopened) / (Total no of Defects reported as fixed + Total no. of new Bugs due to fix)*100

Ex:Total no of defects reported as fixed = 10

Total no. of defects reopened = 2

Total no. of new Bugs due to fix = 1

Defect Fix Rate = ((10 – 2)/(10 + 1))*100 = (8/11)100 = 72.7 = 73%
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Defect Removal Efficiency:
It allows us to compare the overall (defects found pre and post-delivery) defect removal efficiency

Formula:
Defect Removal Efficiency = ((Total no. of defects found pre-delivery) /( (Total no. of defects found pre-delivery )+ (Total no. of defects found post-delivery)))* 100

Ex:Total no. of defects found pre-delivery = 80

Total no. of defects found post-delivery = 10

Defect Removal Efficiency = ((80) / ((80) + (10)))*100 = (80/90)*100 = 88.8 = 89%
