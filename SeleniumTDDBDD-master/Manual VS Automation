When Should I Use Manual vs. Automated Testing?

In short, manual testing is best suited to the following areas/scenarios:

>>Exploratory Testing: This type of testing requires the testerâ€™s knowledge, experience, analytical/logical skills, creativity, and
intuition. The test is characterized here by poorly written specification documentation, and/or a short time for execution. We need 
the human skills to execute the testing process in this scenario.
>>Usability Testing: This is an area in which you need to measure how user-friendly, efficient, or convenient the software or product is
for the end users. Here, human observation is the most important factor, so a manual approach is preferable.
>>Ad-hoc Testing: In this scenario, there is no specific approach. It is a totally unplanned method of testing where the understanding 
and insight of the tester is the only important factor.

Automated testing is the preferred option in the following areas/scenarios:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>Regression Testing: Here, automated testing is suitable because of frequent code changes and the ability to run the regressions in a timely manner.
>>Load Testing: Automated testing is also the best way to complete the testing efficiently when it comes to load testing. Learn more about load testing with our best practices guide.
>>Repeated Execution: Testing which requires the repeated execution of a task is best automated.
>>Performance Testing: Similarly, testing which requires the simulation of thousands of concurrent users requires automation.



Keeping these factors in mind, you can find the best approach in any given testing situation and achieve quality output well within
your budget and timeline.
